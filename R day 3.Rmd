## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
barplot(sample(20:50, 6, replace=F), ylab = "Number of Fans", xlab= "Ice Cream Flavor", names.arg = c("chocolate", "vanilla", "strawberry", "butter pecan", "pistachio", "black cherry"), main = "Number of Fans of Each Ice Cream Flavor", col = c("brown", "white", "pink", "yellow", "green", "purple"), legend.text = c("Choc", "Vani", "Stra", "BuPe", "Pist", "BlCh"))
```
```{r}
smalldata = read.table("small_data.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F, row.names=1)

plot(as.numeric(smalldata[,"Tumor_5"]), as.numeric(smalldata[,"Control_5"]), xlab = "Tumor 5", ylab = "Control 5", main = "Tumor Group 5 w/ Control Group 5", col= "blue")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
