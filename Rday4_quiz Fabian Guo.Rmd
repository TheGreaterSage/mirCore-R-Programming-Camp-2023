## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
smalldataM = as.matrix(smalldata)
plot(smalldata[,"Control_1"], smalldata[, "Tumor_1"])
options(scipen = 10)
logTumor3 <- log2(smalldata[, "Tumor_3"]) + 1
hist(logTumor3)
boxplot(smalldata[c("miR_a", "miR_b", "miR_c"),c("Tumor_1", "Tumor_5", "Tumor_7", "Control_1", "Control_5", "Control_7")])
smalldata_heatmap <- log(smalldata +1)
pheatmap(smalldata_heatmap, cluster_cols=F, scale="column", clustering_distance_rows="correlation", cellwidth=10, cellheight=20, color=colorRampPalette(c("darkblue", "white", "red2"))(256), border_color=NA, main= "Super Heatmap")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
